# Crafting Interpreters

This is a repo that follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. The book is a great resource for learning how to build interpreters and compilers. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is about building an interpreter for a simple language called Lox, and the second part is about building a compiler for the same language.

## Run

```bash
cargo run --bin rlox
```
